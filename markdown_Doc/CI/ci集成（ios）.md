***To make the ci work, we have to follow these steps:***

1 Add .gitlab-ci.yml to the root directory of your repository

2 define some jobs within the yml file

*( Jobs are used to create builds which will be picked by the Runners and executed in runners environment )*

3 Install and Configure a Runner on gitlab
